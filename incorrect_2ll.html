	<h2><center>INCORRECT</center></h2>
	<p><center><font face = "papyrus">The last woolly mammoths died as late as 1650 B.C. on Russiaâ€™s Wrangle Island (from what scientists can tell -- most populations of woolly mammoths disappeared long ago during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene periods, but some still survived on islands in Alaska and Russia).

	By this time, the Egyptian Empire was already extremely advanced and building pyramids. In fact, the Great Pyramid of Giza had existed for 1,000 years by the time the last woolly mammoth disappeared.</font></center></p>
